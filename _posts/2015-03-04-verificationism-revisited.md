Browsing the net in search for more information on the Vienna Circle I came across [the notes on William Lycan and verificationism](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trinity.edu%2Fcbrown%2Flanguage%2Flycan08-verificationism.html) by Curtis Brown from the Trinity University in San Antonio, TX. He discusses Lycan’s approach and comments to objections to the verification theory, which were originally presented in the latter’s 1999 book “Philosophy of Languauge: A Contemporary Introduction”. Having read Lycan’s original text recently, two things striked me in Prof. Brown’s account — one that is actually there and one missing.

## The one that is there
Brown starts by introducing Lycan’s own commentary on Ayer’s understanding of verificationism.

> Ayer seems to use verificationism in two different ways (as Lycan points out on p. 99):
> 1. As a criterion of cognitive significance: a way of distinguishing between sentences that are (cognitively) meaningful (namely, “tautologies,” i.e. analytic truths, and scientific claims) and those that are not (especially metaphysical claims).
> 2. As a theory of meaning, i.e. a way of saying what meaning is and what the meanings of individual sentences are. (Note that unlike some other accounts we’ve looked at, as a theory of meaning, verificationism only applies to complete sentences, not to individual words or phrases.)

So far, so good. But he does not stop there. Then comes a controversy:

>Lycan focuses on (2), verificationism as a theory of meaning. A sentence is verified or falsified (confirmed or disconfirmed) by experience (this is Ayer’s empiricism at work). And the meaning of a sentence, for a verificationist, is the set of experiences that would confirm it. Or, as Lycan puts it:
>For any sentence S, the meaning of S is S’s verification condition.

I am not sure if Lycan himself had approved this distinction. I could not find such revelation in his book, neither the Internet helped me out. However, even if these are Lycan’s own words, they still should be opposed.

The statement that there are two equally important aspects of verificationism looks petty, and it seems even pettier of me to point it out. But I see it as a masked (or accidental, perhaps) attempt to rehabilitate the view in question. It gives hope to verificationist merit in terms of cognitive value. It suggests there is a field of philosophical activity in which verificationism could thrive regardless of the arguments against it presented further on because, according to such an interpretation, they would have, all in all, referred to an independent theory. A suggestion that is rather doubtful.

Ayer’s understanding of cognitive value — as presented in Lycan’s book and Brown’s notes — is not very common. It limits the spectrum of the term to purely physicalist approach. In fact, cognitive value thus defined was taken straight from Carnap’s early texts. Only a verificationist in Lycan’s second meaning could accept the (1) view on determination of cognitive value.

Meaning as tautology is a grand proposition belonging to the core of the verification theory. It cannot be considered regardless of the theory itself. It would deprive it from argumentative background and transform it into an unsupported statement, not a theory. And with support of the verification theory of meaning comes the burden of Lycan’s objections. One cannot reasonably comply with verificationist criterion of meaningfulness without addressing those objections.

It is a humble remark and comes to mind immediately. It should, however, have been made explicit to prevent those common-sense inclinations to claim (1) a useful method which does not need to rely on the more general theory of meaning (2).

## The one missing
Lycan collected seven objections to verificationism. They vary in complexity, they vary in source of criticism — and they do suffice to put down their object. Yet it got me thinking, why come up with all of these arguments if basic Wittgenstein would be perfectly enough? Let’s consider a simple, late-Wittgenstein pre-objection:

**Objection 0:** The verification theory of meaning (and cognitive value) relies on an empirical method of verification, which is based on observations, i.e. protocolar statements. Protocolar statements are supposed to give the account of a subject’s instantaneous impressions, likeMy hand is cold., It smells of roses., I am feeling itchy on the back. But they cannot, since no definition (conditions of correctness) of a private sensation can be given in a public language. Therefore no observation reports the state of the subject’s senses, it only gives an account of a piece of a language game.

In other words, verificationists want us to believe that it is possible to construct comparable private languages. It is but another case of Wittgenstein’s beetle in a box. We all have boxes of sensations accessible to none but ourselves. Our talk of the contents of the boxes would thrive even if they were empty, and therefore has nothing to do with them whatsoever. Such empirical verification is not empirical at all. It depends entirely on a language game which is its sole point of reference.

>That is to say: if we construe the grammar of the expression of sensation on the model of ‘object and designation,’ the object drops out of consideration as irrelevant (Wittgenstein, *Philosophical Investigations*, §293).
