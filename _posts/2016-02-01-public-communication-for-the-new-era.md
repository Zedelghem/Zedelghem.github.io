First times can be terrifying, the first blog post is just daunting. So let's break the ice with a drinking story.

## A drinking story and no punchline
A week or two ago M. and I went to this half a bar, half a coffee shop that's half a block away from her apartament. She is new to the city and drags me to all sorts of events meant for tourists and middle-aged couples looking for a reason to stay together. This time we were to attend a talk on Iceland as seen by a foreigner. However, the place was packed and there was no chance of squeezing into the event space and meet the foreigner in question. Instead, we contented ourselves with a drink at a table near the counter that somehow stood the invasion untouched. And, as every single refuge in this crowded world, it was soon to be disturbed.

So, there came this guy and asked if he could join in. An older guy, with a moustache. You can't expect any good from an older guy with a moustache[^1]. The table was big enough and there really was no reason not to share it, so we went all "Yeah, sure." He joined with a pint, didn't fuss and had no intention to make friends. All that together could only mean a plus one about to arrive. And so he did. There was some standard manly chit-chatting for a while, but after thirty minutes or so you could feel the situation getting pretty tense as the politics talk started. Ryszard, or the moustache guy, turned out to be very well-spoken and yet apparrently he struggled really hard not to get more candid as a streak of clich√©s with an occasional racial slur kept on flowing in from the other side of the table. I controlled myself pretty well until after another pint and with M. away in the restroom, thus unable to stop me. 

The discussion got longer and more heated than any of us would have wanted, but above all - it was utterly pointless. Not pointless in the "We're trashed, we make no sense." way. Not even in the "We represent two entirely different ideological backgrounds, there is no room for agreement." way. It was pointless with the purest pointlessness out there: incapacity to process each other's talking properly. And properly means quickly and accurately enough for it to be meaningful and useful.

## Our brains are just not fit for discussion
Embedded story time: You take a friend for lunch and start a controversial topic. You get emotional, you feel the buzz and desperately want to show her you're right. Or maybe not, maybe you keep the cool, listen to her with full attention and carefully respond to her remarks with refined argumentation. Let's say you win, let's say you lose, or let's say in the end you agree and get all consensual. Now, a quick test: where did it all start? What were the first three points you made? Can you reconstruct your debate further on? Of course you can't, unless you're [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2uRuFgZSDc).

The maximum span of human [working memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory) sticks around 60 seconds[^2]. There is nothing you can discuss in 60 seconds; even a strategy to get to the men's room at your pal's birthday party takes more time to devise. And if you can't go back with reasonable accuracy more than a mouthful words, then you're just mumbling uncontrollably what you believe is right to mumble. Talking with such a brief memory span is plain reacting. It seems late Wittgenstein was right after all, when we talk we're but trained animals playing games; just fitting wooden figures in their places.

Some still might say "Hey, this working memory is one thing but there's also short memory we have. Maybe we can use that?". Working memory actually uses stuff and short memory just stores it. *Storing* and *using* are two distinc functions. These two articles from [Stanford](http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~ashas/Cognition%20Textbook/chapter6.pdf) and [NCBI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/) make a fine introduction to the topic and are really worth a read.

The problem, of course, is not just the one of remembering. And the evidence is out there for all of us to see in our everyday lives. We think too slow, our attention span is pathetic, we are easily distracted and tend to overestimate bodily and psychological features of our interlocutors. We like to debunk our opponents in debate as unsubstantive, but at the same time we can't help judging their looks and pronunciation. We make our minds about people in tenths of a second[^3] and with that we also set our expectations about how meritful their input is likely to be. This isn't a favourable environment for any meaningful discussion, not to mention a process of decision making on big, truly complex issues.

Still, talking is a fun and useful activity - it gives pleausure, it allows coordination of intricate operations, it's an effective way of bonding and a quick communication method for not memory-demanding information. It's just not too great to work through really difficult stuff.

## Politics sucks
Now, all this raises a troubling question. How can we found well-being of our societies and the future of our children on an activity we just suck at as a species? And that's exactly what we keep on doing in the media, politcs and civil activism. In democracies, the most important mean of altering the societal surroundings is through collective decision making. The basis for collective decision making, be it elections, consultations or referendums, is still a series of face-to-face discussions. Journalism, written opinions, reports, analyses and interpreted statistics serve a secondary role. They can be used as a commentary or evidence but no one, in the broad spectrum, treat them as independent voices in the debate[^4]. 

Politics remains a sphere of purely verbal communication. Prospects, programmes and manifestos stay in the business more as a ritual than a serious declaration of anything; they're not crucial even in PR campaigns anymore. Not that it's a recent change for worse, rather a change in the medium of broadcasting nonsense. 19th century had relatively more popular political writing than we have now. Its quality, on the other hand, by no means outmatched our morning TV. What we do know, however, what folks two hundres years could only suspect is that talking is highly ineffective when it comes to thorough analysis and comparison of significant chunks of data over considerable time. Therefore in the light of psychological findings about our actual memory span and the mechanisms of content assessment we should reconsider the shape of the tools that make up our world. There is no reason, apart from orthodox inertion, to stick so stubbornly to the oral way of doing politics and society.

It's a good place to note (thanks to K. for this remark) that the argument has nothing to do with content of communication; it's purely about operational capacity of human brain. Thus the whole type of counterarguments based on the relative character of truth, or subjectivity in general, has no relevance to the issue. The main apprehension here is quite simple: our attention and working memory spans are too short for thorough proccessing of information during an activity so quick and irreversible as conversation. Thus we should not give oral debate a prominent position in the forming of our opinions. Whether there is one truth or many is neutral to this claim.

## What's next?
I denounced speech as not fit for a medium of social change, but what should replace it? Shouldn't we be more conservative about it? After all, who knows if other possible modes of communication will do better? My asnwer is - WE do know. 

There already is a widely used and thoroughly tested method of communicating evidence and opinions that would meet our expectations: it's the academic standard of peer-reviewed publications. It's tried out and as good as we can get. All the problems it generates are incomparably pettier than isuues with the traditional, oral way of doing society. Writing presented with references to evidence and clearly structured arguments, then proofread, discussed and wrapped in counterarguments as the backbone of our political debate would guarantee the quality of our policies skyrocket in no time.

Furthermore, implementation of the scholarly mode to practical political thinking can be done immediately. All it takes for the transition to fulfil itself is politicians doing less talking and more writing, which then would be commented on and presented to the public along with critical remarks. We don't even have to change our political systems to start the revolution. The only initial requirement would be voters evaluating their representatives based on well-structured writing and the quality of arguments rather than performance during the debates. Next, a number of professional journals with a rigorous review system should be founded, for representatives, academics and the public to address the issues in question in an accountable and useful way. Finally, oral debate's role in parliamentary proceedings should be diminished as far as possible and replaced with written communication. Above all, oral debates should not directly precede the casting of votes, because of their high emotional impact.

## Summary & Conclusions
1. Men with moustache are not necessarily lame.
2. Our working memory and attention spans are pretty pathetic.
3. Talking is fun and definitely useful, just not for pondering upon complicated matters and taking important decisions.
4. It's devastating that politics is based on oral communication, regardless of pts. 2. & 3.
5. We have a working solution to pt. 4. that can be implemented on the go - written communication according to the academic standard of peer-reviewed publications.

4. Sure, bureaucracy not only values structured written communication, it truly knows no other. However, bureaucracy isn't even a collective decision making process but a hierarchical sequence of regulated choices. Politics and civic cooperation are different, if not separate, activities and do an entirely different job - they devise framework for bureaucratic regulations.</small>
