Hey,

My name is Borys and I'm a philosophy & physics students based in Warsaw, Poland. For now I do more philosophy (recently in philosophy of language and bioethics) than physics, but I hope it will change quite soon. In the evenings I write to magazines about university and politics and on weekends devour Dimitry Glukhovsky's novels.

Colonial One is my vessel for thoughts on the future of planet Earth and the human species - what they could and couldn't look like, what problems are going to arise and sometimes perhaps even what might help solving them.

If you feel like contacting me, I'm eager and available at: bmjastrzebski /at/ gmail /dot/ com.

Have a good read,
B.
